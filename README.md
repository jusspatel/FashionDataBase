# FashionDataBase
An old programme I created which can act as database for a clothes store (Python + Tkinter + sqlite3)

## Installation
- Downloads files as zip as extract all its content to the same folder .
- Now run the `datafinal.py` file , and the programme should be running

## Works with Python 3.x
